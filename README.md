# Buzzouce client

To serve the client on 0.0.0.0 on port 3333, run:

```
npm run start
```

You can change the hostname and the port in `brunch-config.js`.

If you changed the hostname or the ports of the 3 required servers (Slanger API, Slanger WebSocket or Buzzouce API), update the proper constants in `app/components/config.js`.
